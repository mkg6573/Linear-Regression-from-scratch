# Linear Regression From Scratch 📈

This project implements **Linear Regression from scratch using Python**, without using machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`.  
The goal is to understand the **mathematics and logic behind linear regression**, including cost function optimization using **Gradient Descent**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms in Machine Learning.  
In this project, I built the model step-by-step to understand:

- How predictions are made
- How the cost function works
- How gradient descent minimizes error
- How model parameters are updated iteratively

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Simple Linear Regression
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Cost Function
- Gradient Descent
- Learning Rate
- Model Training from Scratch

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy** (for numerical computations)
- **Matplotlib** (for data visualization)

> ❌ No ML libraries like `scikit-learn` were used.
