# Linear Regression From Scratch 📈

This project implements **Linear Regression from scratch using Python**, without using machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`.  
The goal is to understand the **mathematics and logic behind linear regression**, including cost function optimization using **Gradient Descent**.




## 📊 Mobile Price Prediction Dataset

This dataset is designed to analyze how various smartphone specifications influence mobile prices and overall device value. It provides a structured view of hardware features, software attributes, and connectivity options, making it ideal for **data analysis**, **feature engineering**, and **machine learning model building**.

Although this is not an official commercial dataset, it is well-organized and informative. It helps in developing analytical thinking, understanding feature impact, and gaining hands-on experience with real-world-like data for both academic and professional learning.
